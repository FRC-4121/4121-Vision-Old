By camera serial number (will not work with Microsoft Life Cams!):
	sudo apt-get install v4l-utils

	v4l2-ctl --list-devices
		search for lines containing "/dev/"

	v4l2-ctl -d /dev/videoX -D

		where 'X' is a device listed above
		search for "Video Capture" to distinguish from "metadata device"
		search for "Serial           :" to find the specific camera
	
	v4l2-ctl -d /dev/videoX --list-formats-ext
		will list both "raw" and "mpeg" formats and sample rates


By physical Raspberry Pi USB ports:
	Looking at the ports themselves:

	Within the above directory, inspect 'device/video4linux/video?/dev'.  You will see "major:minor"
	driver revision.  Compare this to the "major, minor" identifiers retrieved from "ls -l /dev/video*".
	The names of the directories under 'device/video4linux' are also the name of the devices under /dev.
